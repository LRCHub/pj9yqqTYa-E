Looking way down the road
Seems like a long way to go
But that's fine, you know you're moving
One step at a time

Eager to be reaching
The place you know He wants you to be
The promise of the future
Is waiting there for you to see

Taking one step at a time
Growing in your heart and mind
When you're walking in faith
You know that you'll get there
One step at a time

Sometimes you can't see His plan
When you think you're not moving
You still understand
It's His signs, keep looking, He'll show you
One step at a time

You know there's a reason
For that place He's put you in
You just keep on listening
He'll tell you when you should begin

Taking one step at a time
Growing in your heart and mind
When you're walking in faith
You know that you'll get there
One step at a time

Every step brings you nearer
The light of truth is getting clearer

Taking one step at a time
Growing in your heart and mind
When you're walking in faith
You know that you'll get there (You know that you'll get there)

Taking one step at a time
Growing in your heart and mind
When you're walking in faith
You know that you'll get there (You know that you'll get there)
One step at a time
