I've been down this road so many times
But I ain't seen nothin' I was driving blind
Now I've woken up and seen the light
And it's fine - so fine

I was pushed until my spirit broke
I sold the pieces and I went for broke
Now I'm back here and I think the joke
Is all on me - it's all on me

The greatest gift of life is the dream, yeah
Believe and then you can build upon it

One step
At a time - and you will get there
One mountain
One mountain to climb - and one is high enough

One dream and you'll set free
Like a tidal wave from the deep blue sea of your dreams
One step - one step at a time

Your body's wet and you just toss and turn
Your skin is crawling and your head just burns
But you ride this nightmare 'til the dawn returns
And you learn - yeah you learn

There is no point in counting up the cost
So raise your glass up to the ones who lost
'Til they return home to the winning post
There is no boss - no boss

The only thing I have is the dream
Believe and then you can build upon it

One step
At a time - and we're gonna get there
One mountain
Just one mountain to climb - and one is high enough

One dream and you'll raise high
A sunray from the burning sky of your mind
One step - one step at a time

Don't even think at all about givin' up – don't give up
The race ain't on 'til the final bell
Yeah you never can tell

One dream and you'll raise high
A sunray from the burning sky in your mind
One step yeah, one step at a time

One step
Just one step at a time
One mountain, just one mountain to climb

One step
Just take one step at a time
One mountain – one mountain to climb
One dream and you'll set free
A tidal wave from the deep blue sea of your dreams
One step – just one step at a time
