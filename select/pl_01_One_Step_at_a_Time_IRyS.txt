Another day, I wander
without escape, I ponder
a million questions
I don't need to find
an answer for
Like is it worth the hassle?
or is it worth the pain?
I look inside the mirror,
and say to myself
Am I enough? ohhh
Am I worth it?
I see the way you notice
all of my fragile moments
a part of me is still uncertain
I should let you in
but as it flows and passes
the time will just confirm
that when you're here with me,
I can just let go
Now suddenly
the clouds clear out
all my worries disappear
and all the stars,
they feel so near
I could almost reach out
right now
Because of you,
I feel myself again
You helped me realize
what I was here to do
Because of you,
I'm feeling real again
now I know where I should go
you got me walking back to hope
One step at a time
I can't explain the feeling
a sorta kinda healing
a different wave of love
that travels
through your precious words
at times I circle back but
I guess I just forget
that when I'm down and low,
I could count on you
Now suddenly
the clouds clear out
all my worries disappear
and all the stars,
they feel so near
I could almost reach out
right now
Because of you,
I feel myself again
You helped me realize
what I was here to do
Because of you,
I'm feeling real again
now I know where I should go
you got me walking back to hope
a step at a time
what can I say but thank you
surrounded by some angels
honestly, it's hard for me
to live without
tomorrow's bringing
something new
i know for certain,
it's worth it
all thanks to you
Because of you,
I feel myself again
You helped me realize
what I was here to do
Because of you,
I'm feeling real again
now I know where I should go
you got me walking back to hope
Because of you,
I feel myself again
You helped me realize
what I was here to do
Because of you,
I'm feeling real again
now I know where I should go
you got me walking back to hope
One step at a time
A little closer
every step gets closer
